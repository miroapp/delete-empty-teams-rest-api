# Miro - Delete Empty Teams Script via API (Node.js)

This repository contains a script in JavaScript/Node.js to delete empty Miro teams using Miro's REST API.

The script provides a __TEST MODE__ flag to run it without performing any changes. (See __step 6__ further below).

## Disclaimer
The content of this project is subject to the Miro Developer Terms of Use: https://miro.com/legal/developer-terms-of-use/<br>
This script is provided as an example to illustrate how to identify Miro Teams with no Boards within and to remove these empty Teams.
The usage of this script is at the sole discretion and responsibility of the customer and is to be tested thoroughly before running it on Production environments.

## Requirements

* [NodeJS 16.x or higher installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* You must be a __Company Admin__ in your Miro account, or at least the user generating the token must be a __Company Admin__ in your Miro account (see steps 3 to 5)
* You must have the role __Content Admin__ assigned, or at least the user generating the token must have the role __Content Admin__ assigned (see step 4 below)

__Note__: If the person running the script is not a __Company Admin__ with the __Content Admin__ role in your organization's Miro account, please have a __Company Admin__ with the __Content Admin__ role in your Miro account follow the __steps 3 to 5__. Once the token has been created, the Miro __Company Admin__ with the __Content Admin__ role can provide the token to the user who will run the scripts to execute the changes.

## Step 1. Install Node.js

1.1. If you already have Node.js installed in your local machine, you may skip this step.

1.2. If you do not have Node.js installed, proceed to download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and proceed to install Node with the downloaded file. (Feel free to use the command line to download and install Node if preferred).

## Step 2. Create directory for your script files

2.1. In your local machine create a folder in the desired location where you will store the files within this repository.

2.2. Download this repository as .zip and extract the files within into the directory created, or clone this repository into the desired location in your local machine.

## Step 3. Create a Developer Team in Miro

3.1. If you already have a Miro Developer Team, you may skip this step.

3.2. If you do not have yet a Miro Developer Team, please visit this [Miro Help](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/4766759572114-Enterprise-Developer-teams) page and follow the instructions within the article to create an Enterprise Developer Team for your Miro Enterprise Account.

## Step 4. Make sure you have the "Content Admin" Role in your Miro Enterprise Account

4.1. To be able to check the true number of Boards within your Miro Enterprise Account (including Boards you have not been invited to) you need to have the role "Content Admin" assigned. To check this, proceed as explained in this [Miro Help](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017571194-Roles-in-Miro#h_01HQ8889WQP2N8PCPRHTPTDNZR) article.

4.2. If you do not appear within the users assigned to the "Content Admin" role, proceed to add yourself to the "Content Admin" users as explained in the Help article mentioned in step 4.1.

## Step 5. Create a Miro App to get a REST API Token

5.1. To create a new application on your Miro Enterprise account using the Enterprise Developer team, navigate to __[Profile settings](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408879513874-Profile-settings) > Your apps__, agree to the terms and conditions, and click on __+ Create new app__.

5.2. Insert the desired app name (e.g. __Delete Empty Teams Script__), select your Developer team for the application and click on __Create app__.

5.3. On the app page, scroll down and select the following scopes of access to grant to your REST API token:<br><br>
  `boards:read`<br>
  `organizations:teams:read`<br>
  `organizations:teams:write`<br>

5.4. Click on __Install app and get OAuth token__

5.5. Select any Production team within your Enteprise account, the token will apply for the entire account based on the scopes set on step 5.3 and click on __Add__

<img src="https://miro-org.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/board_classification/select_team_screenshot.png" alt="Install and and get token screenshot" width="502" />

5.6. You will see the __REST API token__. Copy this token and store it in a secure place. You will need it when running the scripts.

5.7. Find your __Miro Organization ID__ as you will need it when running the scripts. You will find your __Miro Organization ID__ in the URL of the page where you received the REST API token

## Step 6. Run script `deleteEmptyTeams.js` using the command line (CLI)

6.1. With the file `node deleteEmptyTeams.js` replace the below variables at the top of the script:

  - `IS_TEST`: set to `true` to run the script in test mode (no deletions will occur only reports will be generated) - code line `10`
  - `TOKEN`: replace value with your REST API token from step 5.6  - code line `11`
  - `MIRO_ORGANIZATION_ID`: replace value with your Miro Organization ID from step 5.7 - code line `12`

6.2. Save your changes.

6.3. In your command line interface navigate to the directory where you have placed the script files (see step 2.2) 

6.4. In your command line interface run `node deleteEmptyTeams.js`. This command will trigger the script.

## Step 7. Review the folder `miro_teams_deletion_output_files`

Within the same folder where this script lives, the script creates a folder called `miro_teams_deletion_output_files`. Within this folder you will find the below reports:

  - `Miro_Teams_Deletion_Results.csv`: Contains the results of the team deletions in a .CSV file
  - `Miro_Teams_Deletion_Results.json`: Contains the results of the team deletions in a JSON file
  - `Miro_Teams_Overview.csv`: Contains an overview of all teams within the Miro account in a .CSV file
  - `Miro_Teams_Overview.json`: Contains an overview of all teams within the Miro account in a JSON file
  - `Miro_Teams_to_Delete.csv`: Contains the empty teams to be deleted in a .CSV file
  - `Miro_Teams_to_Delete.json`: Contains the empty teams to be deleted in a JSON file
  - `Script_Errors.csv`: Contains API errors (if any) in a CSV file. This report is created only if errors occurred, otherwise the file will not be present
  - `Script_Errors.json`: Contains API errors (if any) in a JSON file. This report is created only if errors occurred, otherwise the file will not be present
